Can three people with a vision, a newly formed company and less resources than
that of their competition, destroy the opposition?

## Capitalism: The Root of All Evil?
Say what you will about capitalism (we can dive into the topic of greed in a
different Blog Post); it's not the perfect system, but it leverages the power
of individual choice to uproot large, stale organizations, and sweep them away
to make room for the new.  It has happened before, it's happening now and it
will happen in the future.

Personally, I do not believe corporations are bad; in fact, I think they are
great. They provide millions upon millions of jobs, and force entrepreneurs to
innovate. It's this innovation which improves the long term quality of
deliverables and the creation of value as a whole. If your idea/product/service
isn't better, blame yourself, not the company that has market share.

## Innovation is Destruction
Large corporations can be difficult to move for a number of reasons.  But, they
are not impossible to move. It all comes down to us, the consumers and the
entrepreneurs, to decide how value is created in our society, because, without
customers, these companies do not exist.

Let's examine the Golden Rule: "Your customer is always right."

That may not be 100% true, our customer may not always be right, but they do
need to be heard, because there is a good chance they are on to something.  For
example: The fine print on a contract means nothing to a customer in most
situations. How many times have you called customer service and they have a
signed copy of your contract which you neglected to read based on a lack of
time and wherewithal.  Who's fault is that, really?

## Take Ownership
I have a few different choices when it comes to internet providers in my area
(internet/cable providers find themselves in an area of limited competition, an
Oligopoly if you will).  In my opinion this is an area where we as consumers
have failed to demand choices, and accepted poor customer service. And,
entrepreneurs have, so far, failed to pursue innovation based on the lack of
performance we have experienced.

The Crux: We can't blame the system or these corporations for what they lack.
The buck stops with us.  To all domain experts: If you can provide a solution
to a problem that benefits the consumer...you are in business.  Take ownership
of it, innovate...Create!!

## Take Action
It is not up to "other people" to dictate what you have to live with. If you're
not an entrepreneur, then you must at least be a consumer. You can take action
and shape industries.  Great organizations are not created out of luck. Steve
Jobs created Apple,
[Pixar](http://www.pixar.com/),
and
[OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT),
while [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)
has created
Paypal,
[Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/)
and
[SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/).
This comes from skill and talent, but most of all from a belief that we can do
better, and the mobilization of consumers to support that belief.
