A few days ago,
[Ben Rattray](https://www.facebook.com/benrattray),
the founder and CEO of [Change.org](http://www.change.org/),
announced the
[investment of $15 million](http://blog.change.org/post/51043602000/how-change-org-is-reaching-scale-while-remaining)
in their company,
a company which has promised to change the world, but has also promised
never to go public or be acquired. This really struck a chord with us at
[Pinfinity](http://www.pinfinity.co), because, like Ben said in his
letter, we have struggled with the decision to be a for profit corporation,
rather than a non-profit. We can sum up our opinion on the matter with a great tag
line, from the incredible website at
[InvisiblePeople.tv](http://invisiblepeople.tv).
It's a site which profiles the stories of many of the people in our world who are homeless
and, on the front page, it reads:

> "Some content may be offensive. Our hope is you'll get mad
enough to do something about it."

That's what social change is all about.

## Mad (and doing something about it).
We founded Pinfinity because we were mad. We're mad that access to information
is *still* not universal. In the world of textbooks for instance, a few
corporate elephants hoard the writings of educators, and then make students,
tax payers, and educators pay through the teeth to support an antique way of
distributing information. We're mad about the health care industry, in general,
for putting profit ahead of patient care.  We know there are great health care
providers out there, who push for quality, and create great things, and make
money doing it, but they're not the ones who grab headlines, unfortunately.

But this doesn't have to happen. At Pinfinity we believe, just like Ben at
Change.org, that we can make profound, positive, changes, and that we can do it
without getting our priorities screwed up.  At Pinfinity, sometimes we have a
bit of a complex, and think we may be better off as a non-profit, but every
time we have that internal argument, we believe, even more firmly, that the
best chance we have at moving the needle on education is to leverage the
for-profit structure.  It was such a huge relief to hear from Ben, his team,
and their investors, that we're not the only ones who believe in this approach.
This statement really hit home:

> "What has helped drive our success is that we've built a scalable business model that provides sustained value. This has enabled us to hire a world-class team of 170 people to build free tools and provide free support for millions of people seeking to create change around the globe."

__Wow. Just wow!__

## Inspiration from a teacher. Are you surprised?
Other than our parents, teachers have the most profound impact on us and how we will
choose to live our lives. It was no different for me.

My least favorite subject was, and still is, Mathematics; which is why I find
it ironic that my favorite teacher just so happened to teach this subject.  I
was privileged to be in Mrs. Vonk's math class during my sophomore and
junior years of high school and saw her in the hallway daily throughout senior
year.  At the time I wasn't impressed with her skill with math, but what caught
my attention was her genuine ability to care for the
overall well-being of her students, outside of 2 + 2 = 4. She demanded respect
and was quick to reciprocate when it was deserved (and maybe even when it
wasn't).  Her agenda was clear, I could see right through her. She
cared and that made me feel comfortable.  At one point in time during college I
was in jeopardy of failing a math course. I called Mrs. Vonk out of the blue
and asked her if she would be willing to help me pass the class.  She agreed
and invited me into her home after not hearing a word from me in seven years.
I passed the class.  She was the type of person whom you'd rather have
be mad at you, as opposed to disappointed in you.  She made me want to perform.
So thank you Mrs. Vonk!

Pinfinity has been designed as a place where you can come to be better. A better
educator, a better student, a better doctor, and a better professional. We've
got a long way to go, but we thought we'd start off on the right foot
if we took a page out of the book that Mrs. Vonk wrote. The "book" of her life
that inspired me to create this company: Transparency and trust.

## This is who we are

__1)__ Pinfinity is a for-profit company, but our priority is to earn your trust.

__2)__ Pinfinity is a digital education company, with a passion for medicine.

__3)__ You have our word, that all of our books will be provided for free until the end of time.

__4)__ We're developing other tools for institutions, hospitals, self published authors, and the health care industry which we hope will both increase the access to, and value of learning materials, as well as help us earn revenue to increase our reach.

## What this means right now
Our founder
[Jeff Eakin](www.linkedin.com/pub/jeffrey-l-eakin-m-d/8/79a/338/)
is busy heading up a huge effort to improve review and testing materials for medical students.
This is one area where access to information has been restricted for far too long.
He's doing this on top of his responsibilities as a surgeon, and his plans for updates to his current
books
[The Gallbladder](/books/the_gallbladder_ibook)
and [The Appendix](/books/the_appendix_ibook).

[Kris Walker](http://www.kixx.name), our software engineer and CIO,
is working on an open source, widget previewer that was inspired by,
[GitHub](https://github.com)
and their overwhelming success. Educators and students will be able to display
the interactive HTML widgets they have crated for their books, preview them in
full working form, as well as give and receive feedback from the community.
We're really excited about this tool, and we can't wait to show it to you.

We're going to start out by encouraging everyone to use it for free, and if we
ever need to charge for it, all of our early adopters with be grandfathered in.

And, lastly, we're collecting contact information for anyone who would like to
[contribute to a future Pinfinity book](/become_a_contributor). It is our hope,
that we can all collaborate on digital learning material, research, and technology,
to do something profound. Our collaborative book experiment has so far, been really
inspirational, and something we hope to continue doing in the future.
