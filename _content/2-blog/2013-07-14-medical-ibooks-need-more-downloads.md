I wrote this post to clear up some confusion I believe was created by a couple of posts over at
[iMedicalApps](http://www.imedicalapps.com/). I tried to comment on their post in the comments
section, but the moderator wouldn't accept my opinion, so I decided to expand on it, and respond
here on our Pinfinity blog.

## iMedicalApps Got It Wrong
The blog post I'm responding to on iMedicalApps is titled
[The Apple iBookstore is in dire need of a medical category](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2013/07/apple-ibook-medical-category/). My main disagreement with the post post is first, a factual one: There actually is
a medical section for iBooks in the iTunes store. Secondly, in my opinion, and our opinion at Pinfinity,
is that we need to do a better job marketing, and disseminating medical content on iTunes to help sort out
this very new space. And that starts with you, early adopters: You should be downloading, sharing, and encouraging
other health care professionals to also download the great iBooks you
find.

## What Is an iBook?
Before we go any further, let's clear up some confusion regarding what the term "iBook" means -- because
it can mean different things to different people.

If you have been an Apple geek for the past fifteen years you may have purchased an iBook;
the little known physical device that most people have forgotten about by now. I am referring to the line of
top computers Apple sold from 1999 to 2006. So, just to clear this up, iBooks Author publishers cannot
actually include the term "iBook" anywhere inside of their iBooks, in the description on iTunes,
or even when are talking to friends (just kidding on that last one). Apple has a trademark on "iBook"
which refers to their retired machine. They do not want to confuse anyone or violate and trademark laws,
but sometimes this makes things confusing for content providers and their respective audience.

However, since everyone is calling the books you download from the iBookstore "iBooks", we're going to
continue to use that term. Confused yet?

There's more.

There are actually two very different types of books which you can consume on your iOS devices: standard ePubs and multitouch or enhanced iBooks. Tablet users are accustomed to the standard ePub because Amazon has been distributing them on their device (Kindle) for quite some time. As time goes on, all of the established, yet stagnant, publishing companies are converting the canonized medical textbooks into this standard, stagnant ePub format.

The new
[enhanced multitouch books](http://www.apple.com/education/ibooks-textbooks/)
are what we are passionate about at Pinfinity. Multitouch iBooks include enhanced tactile learning features and content including: videos, images, keynote presentation, interactive 3-dimensional images and practice questions, etc. McGraw Hill ain't makin' these. These revolutionary digital pieces require an intense amount of committment and audacity to crank out a worthy product. Trust me, we are still trying to do this better after two years of practice. Here is a list of some great examples of these that books we have reviewed which are either free or inexpensive, and which you should definitely check out for yourself:

## There Is a Medical Section in the iTunes iBookstore
In contrast to what Tom Lewis said in his most recent article on iMedicalApps, medical iBooks can be found by searching within the
[Professional and Technical](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGrouping?cc=us&id=27843)
section of the iBookstore. Once you enter this room within the iTunes client you will be able to click on the Medical tab in a scrollable section half way down the page. This scrollable area includes but is not limited to: nursing, law, engineering and medicine etc. Try it out by clicking
[this link](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGrouping?cc=us&id=27947&mt=11)
from your Laptop, Desktop or iOS device.

The enhanced multitouch books are available within both the medical domain of the iTunes ecosystem as well as the
[textbook section](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGrouping?cc=us&id=132345).
You can identify the difference between an enhanced multitouch iBook and a standard ePub by looking at the description along the left side of the page, which will say the following: "This 
book includes video and other interactive material."

<h2 style="clear: both;">iMedicalApps Got One Thing Right (And This is What We Need to do to Proliferate Multitouch Books in Medicine)</h2>
Even though there is a medical domain within the iTunes Bookstore, it is hard to find reference, educational, and review resources for medicine and healthcare. If you go to the iTunes Bookstore today I bet you will find that the number one free iBook in medicine is
*[40 Juicing Recipes for Weight Loss and Healthy Living](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/40-juicing-recipes-for-weight/id641874659?mt=11)*.

__Side note:__ Before you start juicing you may want to cut out the high fructose corn syrup, and start walking 3 miles a day, but that is a different blog post.

Anyway, the medical domain in the iTunes iBookstore is in disarray for medical professionals because Apple is still trying to figure out how to sort this type of content. What is reference for nurses versus a manual for the health crazed people cruising through iTunes? From what we know and what we've heard from our contacts at Apple, they are working on a solution for this problem, which is much more complex than you may think. In the meantime, you can help by simply downloading pertinent multitouch iBooks geared towards nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals. Don't waste time downloading the standard ePubs, but reach for the enhanced multitouch books and support the digital revolution in medical education. Give up your rotary phone and move into the 21st century with us. The more we (healthcare professionals and medical learners) download these books, the more the ecosystem will sort itself out. And maybe someday when a surgeon goes to the iBookstore to learn about The Gallbladder he or she won't have to read about some non-evidence based quack "flush or diet". Adoption is the key. So be an early adopter and help Apple sort the medical domain if you are a medical professional looking for cool revolutionary medical books for your iPad. 

P.S. Take it from a gastrointestinal surgeon: Avoid having anything travel backwards in this part of your body, no matter how much Google or iTunes results page supports it. Maybe you should just eat better, exercise more and stop searching for that magic "coffee enema."
