__To the students:__ Pinfinity is dedicated to you. Digital publishing has
dramatically changed the way information should be presented in a learning
environment, and there is no other field where the change to digital content is
more important than in medicine.  Our hats are off to you, and the path you
have chosen. We hope our books will eventually allow you to break free of the
textbook publishing machine and chart your own path through your career.

__To professionals:__ We hope you find Pinfinity books to be insightful enough,
that between your long hours caring for your patients, you'll look forward to a
few moments with a multi-touch book to further your knowledge. Thank you for
all you do. We take great pride in our responsibility to help you do it even
better.

__For the patients:__ Nothing would make us more proud than to hear your stories of
downloading one of our books in order to better understand your own healthcare.
Medicine can be intimidating and full of anxiety, but knowledge empowers, and
overcomes. We're there for you.

Most of all, Pinfinity is here to buck the status quo in medical education.
Access to information should be free, __especially__ when it comes to our
healthcare. We will strive to produce the most engaging medical learning
material in the digital age, and we will do it while asking nothing in return
from our readers. Medicine is simply too important for you to be forced to
continue lining the pockets of big, stale, publishing houses.

Maybe we're crazy, but then, maybe that's a good thing.
