If you're not familiar with
[iBooks Author](http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/),
it is the primary drag and drop editing and layout tool for producing
multi-touch textbooks for use on the iPad.  If you're coming from the
publishing world you could compare iBA to
[Adobe InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html)
, and if you're coming from the web development world, you could think of it kind of like
[Adobe Dreamweaver](http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html)
for iBooks.

We love iBooks Author at Pinfinity, but what we love most is creating
multi-touch textbooks for two reasons: A) We can democratize the creation of
the textbooks that students are learning from, and B) introduce a richer and
more effective learning experience than any we've seen since the printing
press.

So, counting down from 7, here are our top feature requests to Apple for
iBooks Author:

### 7: Include in iWorks for iCloud
Yeah, so we'll just start off with our pipe dream. We know it would be a
colossal engineering feat to put a layout engine like iBooks Author into a web
browser. Still, the ability to work on our books online would be a huge leap
forward in open source and collaborative book development. Swing for the fences
Apple engineers!

### 6: Fix the HTML Widget Experience
When you create an HTML5 widget and embed it in your multi-touch book, the user
is thrown out of the reading experience when they open the widget on the iPad.
It would fantastic if we could define the size of our widget, so that it
remained embedded in the text and would still allow the user to interact with
it as normal. If you wanted to, you could still make your widget blow up to
full screen when it opened. The native iBA widgets already work this way, so it
should not be a total moon shot to get it done. This small change would make a
big improvement in the learning experience from our perspective.

### 5: Edit HTML and CSS Source
Most people get a little sick to their stomach when exposed to HTML and CSS for
the first time. That's okay, you get used it after a while.  That said, there
are some nice design and interactivity features we'd like to include in our
books if we could edit the HTML and CSS that makes up a multi-touch text book.
But, currently, that's impossible in iBA. In fact, it may never be possible,
because iBA does not work on the HTML &amp; CSS in an .ibooks file, but works
on the much more complicated and intricate XML in an .iba file instead. The XML
in an .iba file even makes me throw up a little in my throat.

__Side Note:__ *You can currently edit the HTML and CSS in your .ibooks file
once it has been exported from iBooks Author. The problem is that the only way
to preview it is to send it to your iPad through iTunes, since iBA can't open
.ibooks files. We have not done this for our first two books, but we've been
doing a lot of experimentation and hope to have some interesting stuff to show
you soon.*

### 4: An API
An API stands for
[Application Programming Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
, and it's a way for programmers to design their systems to share information
with other systems that also have an API. If you're familiar with the plugins
you can install in Photoshop, then you've been using the API that Adobe has
provided to developers like us to create third party plugins for this type of
software.

We'd love to be able to automatically import manuscript text, images, widgets,
and other material into iBooks Author for final layout and publication, but we
can't because iBA does not have an API.  Supposedly Apple is considering working on
this, but their engineers have security concerns.  My guess is that the
security concerns are not much to worry about, but that they just have a lot of
other stuff on their plate right now. So we're keeping our fingers crossed
and hoping to see this at some point in the near future.

### 3: Open an ePub File
Even if iBA could never export an ePub file, it would be great to be able to
open one and edit it. The idea would be to use iBooks Author to get an ePub
behaving properly for export as an .ibooks multi-touch book. This will probably
never happen, but it's an interesting idea.

### 2: Open an iBooks File
We thought this one was a no-brainer, but either Apple is not
interested in allowing iBA to open it's own .books files, or they don't
see it as a priority. Our guess is the latter because, again, there are limited
engineering resources to go around, and the scope of the iBooks Author project
needed to be narrowed to the minimal number of features needed to get self
publishing authors off the ground. Needless to say, this feature is *almost*
our most needed request for Apple and iBooks Author.

### 1: Open *Any* Structured Text File
The only thing better than opening an ePub or .ibooks file would be the ability
to open *any* structured text file.  By "structured text" we mean any sort of
plain text which carries additional information about chapters and sections,
and even links and other interactive elements. This could be an HTML or XML
file, but we're really partial to a little wiki editing language called
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
We encourage you to give it try at [Dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/).

Imagine multiple authors working on a Markdown document together on Google
Drive, Dropbox, [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/) (our personal favorite), or
[Box.com](https://www.box.com/). Then, one person with iBA could open or
import the Markdown file, and iBA would automatically lay out all the chapters,
sections, and links. It would also provide spots indicating where interactive
elements are intended to go.  Updating the book with the latest content from
the authors would be a simple matter of importing the new Markdown manuscripts,
which would update all the content, but still leave it to the editor to perfect
the design, layout, and interactive elements within iBooks Author.

Cool, huh?
