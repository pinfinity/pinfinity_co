Pinfinity is looking for a web developer!

You'll be creating a new website, from a project scaffolding that will be setup for you, in a fresh new code repo (don't you love that new repo smell?). The design will be provided in the form of a style guide and a wireframe, which you'll be expected to adhere to for the most part.

We'd like you to take your first pass at the implementation as quickly as possible, making a big mess out of everything, and then iterate to refinement after that.

We're offering $3,000 for what will be a 1, 2, or 3 page website, which is currently being designed. We've ruled out WordPress and Drupal, and are leaning strongly toward [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Statamic](http://www.statamic.com/). It's Ok if you are not familiar with these frameworks, they are really easy to learn!

## Here's a list of expectations:
- We'd like you to commit to at least 20 hours per week.
- We'd like the project to be completed within 60 hours.
- You should be very familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
- Experience and opinions with things like Bootstrap, Foundation, Grunt, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails will be a benefit.
- Candidates with a strong GitHub profile and active Twitter account will be held in higher regard than those without.
- You should be amusingly humourous, sarcastic at times, opinionated about development frameworks, and have a good reason for not using a Mac if you in fact do not use a Mac.

If you are interested, contact me, [Kris Walker](https://twitter.com/kixxauth) at [kris@pinfinity.co](mailto:kris@pinfinity.co).
