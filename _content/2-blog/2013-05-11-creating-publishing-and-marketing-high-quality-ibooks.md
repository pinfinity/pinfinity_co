There is already a lot of ink spilled over tips and tricks for using iBooks
Author to create fancy books.  So I've decided to write a post to give you a
different perspective, as an iBooks author, on the high level points that make
a great multi-touch book.  At Pinfinity, our belief is that we should be
talking about ways to make multi-touch iBooks which are the most innovative and
effective teaching tools known to mankind. This post is focused on the
importance of quality content, and our perspective on how to ensure our content
is valuable to our readers.  I want you to ignore the forces drawing you
towards making a 99 cent piece of eye candy, and see if we can't explore ways
to make some brain candy.

## Content Creation and Curation is the Crux
We've found the most time-consuming process of creating an iBook is content
creation. Creating and distilling effective content is a monster task and, in
the end, requires a team effort over an individual effort. That's why our first
piece of advice on creating a great multi-touch textbook is collaborate,
collaborate, collaborate.

## Finding Collaborators for Your Book
Perhaps the hardest part of collaboration is finding knowledgeable people to
work with.  If nobody comes to mind right away, think of this as an opportunity
to expand your network, and be an expert in your subject.  Luckily, finding and
meeting new people is easier than ever with the tools and communities on the
Web.  One such community that offers great support for K-12 and higher
education is the
[iBooks author collaborative](https://plus.google.com/communities/112862452781960201400/stream/3a343c87-0e99-406f-91ee-25bc3c21a195)
run by moderators
[Steve Dickie](https://twitter.com/falconphysics) and
[Anthony DiLaura](http://adilaura.blogspot.com/).

We know there will not be an existing community for everyone, so if you can't
find a community that supports your mission, why don't you create one?  That's
what we did when we were first getting Pinfinity off the ground.  Our goal is
to make free medical and surgical education books, and when we started our
movement we knew we were going to need help. So we created a group on LinkedIn
called
[Medical Education iBooks](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Medical-Education-iBooks-4888885).
Taking the initiative has created exposure for our idea, and now people are
helping us create exposure for their ideas; it is quite symbiotic. This
perspective, and willingness to share information, has given Pinfinity great
traction, and brought our community closer together.

So, start your own collaborative, community, hashtag or Facebook page.  And
trust us, if you build it they will come; it just takes time. Be persistent.

## Curating Quality in a Multi-touch Book
Curation is almost as difficult as creation. It's more than just editing text,
it's the process by which you add value to the text.

__Don't let the awesome sauce distract you:__ Because of the powerful, and
frankly, fun to use, tools in iBooks Author you can be easily distracted.
Don't let your creativity flow too freely. Remember, that just because you can
do something doesn't mean you should. Don't spend five hours trying to make
HTML widgets, just because you *can* make an HTML widget (in reality, it will
most likely be 5 days).  Stick to what you know and what you're good at.
Utilize media assets that are simplistic, but when integrated with your text
and a tactile multisensory format, they enhance the book *as a learning tool*
and make it better than the current status quo in textbooks.

__Stand on the shoulders of others:__ One really great way to increase the
value of your book, while remaining focused on your subject matter, is to
repurpose existing media. There is a wealth of media available on the Internet
which was put there by the creators specifically for you to freely use. Study
[Creative Commons licensing](http://creativecommons.org/)
and learn how you can repurpose existing content, licensed under a Creative
Commons license, to augment and enhance your learning tool.

It is important to reference content you find, and give respect to those who
created them in your book. Just add a URL pointing to the origination site for
that image or video that you've utilized. This adds to your book in two
important ways: You give a shout out to the wonderful person who created the
content and made it available to the world with a Creative Commons license, and
you create additional layers of information so your students can delve as deep
as they want to into the subject matter.

At Pinfinity we make medical and surgical books, and with a little research, we
found that the
[National Science Digital Library](http://nsdl.org/)
has a treasure trove of wonderful images that help demonstrate a lot of the
points we try to teach in our books.

## Release Your Book Early

Focus on getting the product out quickly. This is your test. There is no way to
find out if your book is any good, until you put it into the hands of an
audience. If you are not a little bit embarrassed by the first release of a new
title, then you've waited too long. Once you let your inhibitions go, and put
your work out there, then you'll start thinking of real ways to improve it;
improvements that you *know* will make an impact, not those that you *think*
will make an impact.

The beauty of the iBooks platform is that you have the ability to push a new
product to every one of your readers globally on a continual basis. It is not
like the old publishing regime, where, once the manuscript was done, you lost
control of your work.  Don't ever forget that you now have the ability to
continually update and improve your work. And, in the end, if you keep making
updates, you will keep the attention of your audience and they will always be
looking forward to new material. This is a paradigm shift, and, at Pinfinity, we
believe it may be the most important aspect of the iBooks platform.

## Distribution and Marketing
Now that you've created your book, curated the content, and have created the
most valuable learning tool known to mankind, you have to figure out how to get
it to mankind.  The biggest mistake you can make (other than waiting too long
to release) is to release it and then do nothing, hoping everyone will stumble
on your book, download it, read it, and tell all their friends how amazing you
are. The sad truth is that most people don't know you and are not even aware
your book exists.  You have to get over your inhibitions and be a marketer.

As engineers, scientists, and doctors, we often think of marketing as somehow
sugar coating a product, or making it appear to be more than what it is. While
that is true with bad marketing, it is not true for good marketing. You need to
be a good marketer, not for your sake, but for the sake of all the people in
the world who hunger for your material, but don't even know that it exists.

## Don't Publish and Market Like a Publisher
__Focus on what you control:__ We could go on and on about the trials and
tribulations of trying to upload a book to iTunes but we all know it's just a
pain in the butt. The good news is that, we are confident, from our sources at
Apple, that they are working hard to fix this process. But what really matters
is the decisions you make when you're utilizing iTunes producer to upload your
book. So let's focus on the stuff that you can control, rather than the stuff
that is out of your control.

__Free, in more ways than one:__ Earlier, I talked about grassroots
collaborative efforts and at this point I have worn out the word "free". But
that's because, at Pinfinity, we believe in free education. I know a lot of
people that are reading this blog post now are probably thinking about jumping
ship because we're are not handing out advice for making your next $60,000 with
iBooks author and a few weeks of your time.  But, for those of you that want to
stay on board, let's talk about how we can use __free__ to our advantage, and
profit from it.

__Your audience comes first:__ It all boils down to cultivating a passionate
audience. If you want to charge 99 cents for a 30 page book on cow farts go
ahead. But, if you want to distribute a book about algebra, and organize your
community behind it then you are far more likely to cultivate a passionate
audience with a free book; and now were talking about distribution and mass
adoption. That will position you as a thought leader in your area of expertise.
It will accelerate your career, and give you the opportunity to create and
market other material for a profit.  Your audience will be hungry for it,
because they are passionate about your subject matter, and trust your
motivations.

__Compete where quality and passion are the winners:__ If you want to upload a
book up for $7.99 you are going to be competing with the high-end established
textbook companies. And these are companies that partner with Apple long before
you've even had a chance to get your iBooks Author template out of the App
store. So competing with them on this level is going to be difficult. Instead,
compete on a completely different playing field. Why not compete in the free
textbook section where quality truly is the cream that rises to the top?

## Don't Forget Why You are Creating a Digital Book

This is perhaps the most most important component of your book: People don't
care about what you created, they care about
[why you created it](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html).
We are entering a new paradigm in learning, democratizing the educational
process. Don't ever forget that. Don't think like an old publisher.

Watch Simon Sinek's talk below about how great leaders inspire action. It'll be
worth your time.
