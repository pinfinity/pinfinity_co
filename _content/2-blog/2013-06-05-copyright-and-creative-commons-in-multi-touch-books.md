Multi-Touch books bring together a smorgasborg of content, including text, video,
and images, all of which is going to require your attention when it
comes to copyright laws. In a previous post we talked about how important
[collaboration and open source contribution](/blog/creating-publishing-and-marketing-high-quality-ibooks) is
going to be for creating high quality multi-touch textbooks.  As multi-touch
book authors we not only have to understand what copyright licenses we should
release our own work under, but how to interpret the licences used by the
creators of the videos, images, and other gadgetry we put in our books.

But, when we break this down, it's really not too bad. As you work on multi-touch books
and iBooks Author, this will all become old hat
for you before long.

So, first, let's talk about copyright in general, the new Creative Commons
licenses, and then how to license your work and find other work you can use in
your books.

## You Don't Have to Do Anything
That's not quite true. You have to do something creative first. Doing nothing
is probably not considered creative enough to grant copyright in most law
abiding nations. That said, as soon as you scribble your first drawing with a
crayon, the moment you show your mom, it is protected by copyright law.

Without copyright protection anyone could claim, copy, sell, destroy, or use
your first crayon scribbles in their new $59 coffee table book without your
permission.  But, because of copyright law, everyone, including your mom, must
get proof of permission from you (usually in writing) before they can do any of
the following:

* Reproduce your work.
* Create derivative works.
* Distribute your work.
* Perform the work publicly.
* Display the work publicly (Moms: You need written permission before displaying noodle artwork on the fridge).

In the United States, you have this protection on all your work for something
like 70 years after you die.  Thank the Walt Disney Corporation for that one.
That's a whole other story. Just add 70 to 1966 and you can predict when Disney
Corp will be challenging the 70 year thing again.

__There is one caveat to all this legal protection:__ If the work is not
creative enough, none of this applies. A simple collection of facts is not
protected by the law. An expression of Einstein's Theory of Relativity is not
protected by copyright law, unless it is an expanded version, presented in a
new and creative way. Just because you worked really hard on something does not
mean it is copyrighted. This is called the
[Sweat of the Brow Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow)
which came to a head in the US during a
[copyright battle over a phone book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications_v._Rural_Telephone_Service).

## Fair Use: Quote, Cite, and Make Fun Of
But, get this: If you need to use bits and pieces of a copyrighted work to make
fun of the author, you're free to do so. This is the land which grants us the
right to the pursuit of happiness after all.

Seriously though, it's called
[fair use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)
and it allows people to use limited portions of your work for commentary,
search engines, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching, library
archiving, and general scholarship. Fair use gets really blurry, and it's
important that you understand what it means at the core. All the "rules of
thumb" you hear out there about fair use (10 seconds of music, 1,000 words, 10%
of a book) are not hard and fast rules, and could be challenged in court. When
that happens, the following considerations should be applied by the court when
deciding how to rule:

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

## Granting Rights
Let's assume for a moment that you want to make money with the book you wrote.
You probably don't want anyone else selling it for themselves and, by
default, nobody can, except you, under copyright law.

But existing copyright law, the kind you get by default when the glue dries on
your noodle art, does not have any provisions for some of the other things you
may want to do with your work.

But, let's assume you also want to get famous, or at least promote your career,
or you want to pass around useful information, like what you would find in a
textbook, and allow other people to be able add to it and improve it along the
way. In that case, you need to grant each person written permission to create
derivative works, and distribute your work and their work, while making them
promise to give you credit for the original. That doesn't sound too bad until
you consider we live in a world where our work is getting zipped around the
globe to millions of people a second on the backs of electrons and light
particles.

## Creative Commons to the Rescue
The
[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)
is a nonprofit legal organization formed in 2001 by some of the brightest minds
in copyright law to solve this problem of granting some, but not all rights, to
millions of people in an instant. They did this by creating 6 layers of
copyright licenses which grant various levels of permissions, typically held by
you as the copyright holder, to anyone who downloads a copy of your work.

To use a Creative Commons license, you simply visit their website, choose the license
that does what you want it to do, and add the "badge", usually along with a hyperlink
in the case of multi-touch books. More about this below, but here is a summary
of the licenses:

### Attribution, Non-Commercial, No Derivatives
With this license people can download your book and share it with others as
long as they give you credit for it, but they cannot change it or make
commercial use of it.

### Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike
If you want people to be able to build on your book and use parts of it in
their own book, but you want them to promise to give you credit for all your
stuff, and you don't want them to be allowed to sell it for money, and you also
want them to use this same license for the resulting work so more people can
contribute to and build on it, then this is the license for you.

### Attribution, Non-Commercial
This license requires anyone who downloads your book to give credit to you for
anything they re-use in their own books, and forbids them from selling the
resulting work for money.

### Attribution, No Derivatives
With this license people can download your work and distribute or sell it, as
long as they give you credit for it, and do not make any changes to it.

### Attribution, Share Alike
This license allows people to pretty much do anything with your book, as long as they
give you credit for it. But, any derivative works they might create from this work
must carry this same license.

### Attribution
If you want to give everyone free reign over your book, as long as they give
you credit somewhere in whatever they create out of it, this is the license you
want.

If you want to go into more detail, you can get really deep into this stuff on
the Creative Commons
[licenses page](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/).
Just make sure you can climb back out of it when you've got it figured out.  If
that's all to much, they have a slightly less complicated
[license choosing thingamajig](http://creativecommons.org/choose/)
that you can use decide on the proper license for your book.

Just keep in mind, that most governments do not actively enforce copyright law.
It's up to you to find and sue copyright violators whether you're using a
Creative Commons license or just releasing your work under the default
copyright laws. In most cases you probably don't care enough to chase somebody
down, but you may want to hold the big publishers accountable.

## Licencing Your Muli-Touch Book With Creative Commons
Giving your book a Creative Commons license is relatively easy thing to do. Once
you've decided on which license to use (maybe using the license choosing tool
mentioned above), it's just a matter of marking one of the introductory pages
of your book with the appropriate badge and copyright notices.  If you're using
iBooks Author to create your book, you can simply download the Creative Commons
badge (the white, black, and grey image with the symbols on it) and insert it
into your book, then add a link to yourself (a website or social media profile
that you own), and to the license that you are applying to the book.

The Creative Commons website goes into much more detail about
[how a Creative Commons mark should look](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Creators)
when you're done, so you should definitely check that out.

## Using Creative Commons Content
If you're using Creative Commons licensed content in your book, things can get
a bit more complicated, but it is still waaaay easier than asking dozens of
creators for specific written permission to include their stuff in your
multi-touch book like you would have to do under conventional copyright laws.

So here's the scoop:

__If you're going to sell your book for money__ you can't have any content in
there that is released with a Creative Commons Non-Commercial license, which
excludes 3 out of the 6 licenses available.

__If you need to edit or otherwise modify__ the works you plan on including in
your book, you'll need to make sure that the content you choose does not have a
No Derivatives license.

__Keep in mind__ that when you use a piece of work with a Creative Commons
Share Alike license, then you must release your finished book with the same
license as the creator of the original work did. Can you see how this would
create some problems if you had multiple pieces of content with different Share
Alike licenses all in the same book?

__Lastly__ make sure that you give the original creator credit by putting a hyperlink
to them in your book. All Creative Commons licensed works require attribution, so
make sure you are giving credit where credit is due. The Creative Commons website
gives some great best practices for
[properly attributing credit](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Users)
to the original creator of the works you are using.

## Use It
That's it. Use it.

Remember, that all your work is protected by existing copyright laws by default
(as long as it is considered to be somewhat creative). That means nobody is
going to be able to legally use your work in their books without bugging you
with emails. So, you need to to make sure to apply one of the Creative Commons
licenses to your multi-touch book so that it can be shared instantly around the
world without having to give written permission to everyone who obtains a copy.

Lastly, there are a lot of great people out there creating great content, and much
of it is carrying a Creative Commons license. You should use it, and give the creators
credit for their work, which will make you both instantly famous.
