At [Pinfinity](/) we love the endless possibilities of using HTML5 widgets to
introduce interactivity into multi-touch textbooks.  As long as we are
responsible, and learn the best use cases for these tools, we think there is a
tremendous amount of untapped potential to change the learning experience from
within a textbook.

And while services like
[Bookry](https://bookry.com/)
offer a great way to
[generate widgets](https://bookry.com/widgets/)
for your own books, without having to do HTML5 coding, there is still something
missing from the multi-touch textbook community.  We really wanted to have a
place where we could share and preview widgets, outside of an iPad, without
requiring iBooks Author, and online where everyone could easily access them.

We couldn't find what we needed, so we built an online HTML5 widget preview tool
for ourselves a couple weeks ago. We really like it, and thought the
multi-touch author community at large would like it too. So, we created a
sort of widget gallery out of it and put it on our website for you to try out.

You can browse community contributed widgets, preview them (just as if you were
in a multi-touch book on an iPad), and download them. We're hoping that authors
will use this to collaborate on and share their widgets online, and make the
community stronger, in general.

So, have a look at our new
[HTML5 Community Widget Gallery](/hub/gallery/)
and be sure to upload one of your own creations.

We've got a lot more ideas for things we can do to improve collaboration on
multi-touch textbooks, and we wish we could have built it all yesterday. But,
these things take time, and we thought this tool would be a good first step,
and hopefully something that you'll find useful.

We'd love your feedback. Feel free to email me (lead software developer at
Pinfinity) at

or hit me up on Twitter at

Thanks and enjoy!
