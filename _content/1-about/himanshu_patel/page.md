Himanshu resides just on the other side of the pond, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, UK, where he recently graduated from The University of Leicester.
He has some unpublished work that he is currently working on, and plans to start the UK Foundation Programme post, as well as study for the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Exam) with the eventual goal of practicing medicine in the US. Himanchu is leaning towards specializing in Internal Medicine, though he also has specialist interests in endocrine, oncology and cardiovascular medicine.
