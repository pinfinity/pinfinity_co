Salomi Lakdawala is from Mumbai, India, where she studied at the University of Seychelles American Institute of Medicine until her graduation in May 2010.
In the near future Salomi plans to get an IM residency in the US followed by a fellowship. In the more distant future she hopes to teach, travel and find an area of social work where she can make a big difference. In the far off future Salomi also plans to own and operate her own cafe and bake shop.

We've seen it, seemingly a million times: Great people love to travel and teach.

And, we can't wait to relax with a cup of tea in her bake shop some day! (Assuming she serves tea ... hoping she will.)
