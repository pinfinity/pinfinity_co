Nikhil hails from Mumbai, India and graduated from the University of Seychelles American Institute of Medicine (USAIM) in October 2010. He's focused on getting an Internal Medicine residency, Cardio fellowship and Research, becoming a Medical author, sharing knowledge, leading the field of Social Medicine, playing soccer (football to the rest of the world), travel, and much more. His desired specialty is Internal Medicine, and then, hopefully one day, Cardiology.

Ambitious? Yes. With no apologies.
