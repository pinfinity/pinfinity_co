David is a business school graduate who has spent the
majority of his career in the medical field as a sales representative (we love
him anyway). He has a passion for the advancement of medicine, which was
showcased when he co-founded Pinfinity with his friend Jeff. David is possibly
the most talented individual on the planet when it comes to putting the right
people together to do something great. He is the Chief of Operations at
Pinfinity, but you could call him the chief cat herder, digital marketing
strategist, or an online collaboration specialist, depending on the hour of the
day. If we could afford an insurance policy on him, it would be a big one.
