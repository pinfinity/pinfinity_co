Liz is an interior designer by training, but, most
importantly to us, a great creative artist on any level. Those beautiful
anatomical images you see in our books? Yeah, she did that, and yes, they are
original watercolors. It is still a mystery to us where she gets the ability to
do this (especially with two little aspiring "artists" at home), but just don't
ask questions and enjoy it.
