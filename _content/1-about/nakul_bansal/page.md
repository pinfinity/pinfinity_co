Nakul hails from Panchkula, Haryana, India and is scheduled to graduate from Pt. B. D. Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, in 2014. He hopes to earn a paediatric residency in the USA and plans to do molecular research.

One more thing; Nakul hopes to be a fiction author some day. We can't wait to read his first novel, and hope he remembers us when he's famous.
