Kris is trained in film and multi-media production, but
when the World Wide Web thing got big, he correctly surmised that learning
computer programming would be a good use of time.  Currently, Jeff and Dave
have barricaded him in an undisclosed location where he is busy as the Chief
Information technologist for Pinfinity, building websites and the software used
for creating amazing multi-touch books for you. But, when he is not working on
the next piece of our digital media empire, Kris can usually be found trying to
get to the top of some big mountain (and safely back down).
