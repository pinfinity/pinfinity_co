			<h3 class="header light">Jeffrey Eakin M.D.</h3>
			<p class="bio"> Jeff is our visionary. And, like every true entrepreneur,
he's the one who risks life and limb to make all the tough decisions needed to
set the ship on the right course (at least until the next time we change
course).</p>
			<p class="bio">We hear he's also a pretty good surgeon. From what we
know, he has completed a Minimally Invasive, Bariatric and Robotic Surgery
Fellowship at the Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery at The Ohio State
University Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Scott Melvin. These days
he is practicing Minimally Invasive Gastrointestinal Surgery, in addition to
authoring multi-touch books to teach you all about it. So, to be frank, Jeff
knows his stuff.</p>

			<h3 class="header light">David Wilmert</h3>
			<p class="bio">David is a business school graduate who has spent the
majority of his career in the medical field as a sales representative (we love
him anyway). He has a passion for the advancement of medicine, which was
showcased when he co-founded Pinfinity with his friend Jeff. David is possibly
the most talented individual on the planet when it comes to putting the right
people together to do something great. He is the Chief of Operations at
Pinfinity, but you could call him the chief cat herder, digital marketing
strategist, or an online collaboration specialist, depending on the hour of the
day. If we could afford an insurance policy on him, it would be a big one.</p>

			<h3 class="header light">Kris Walker</h3>
			<p class="bio">Kris is trained in film and multi-media production, but
when the World Wide Web thing got big, he correctly surmised that learning
computer programming would be a good use of time.  Currently, Jeff and Dave
have barricaded him in an undisclosed location where he is busy as the Chief
Information technologist for Pinfinity, building websites and the software used
for creating amazing multi-touch books for you. But, when he is not working on
the next piece of our digital media empire, Kris can usually be found trying to
get to the top of some big mountain (and safely back down). </p>

			<h3 class="header light">Liz Wilmert</h3>
			<p class="bio">Liz is an interior designer by training, but, most
importantly to us, a great creative artist on any level. Those beautiful
anatomical images you see in our books? Yeah, she did that, and yes, they are
original watercolors. It is still a mystery to us where she gets the ability to
do this (especially with two little aspiring "artists" at home), but just don't
ask questions and enjoy it.</p>
