Jeff is our visionary. And, like every true entrepreneur,
he's the one who risks life and limb to make all the tough decisions needed to
set the ship on the right course (at least until the next time we change
course).

We hear he's also a pretty good surgeon. From what we
know, he has completed a Minimally Invasive, Bariatric and Robotic Surgery
Fellowship at the Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery at The Ohio State
University Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Scott Melvin. These days
he is practicing Minimally Invasive Gastrointestinal Surgery, in addition to
authoring multi-touch books to teach you all about it. So, to be frank, Jeff
knows his stuff.
