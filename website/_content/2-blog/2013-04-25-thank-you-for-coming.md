title: Thanks for Being One of the First

To all the medical students out there, Pinfinity is dedicated to you. We are
driven by a desire to spread knowledge. Digital publishing has changed the way
information should be presented in a learning environment. There is no other
field where the change to digital content is more important than in medicine.
Our hats are off to you, and the path you have chosen. We hope our books will
eventually allow you to break free of the textbook publishing machine and chart
your own path through your career.

To medical professionals; we hope you find Pinfinity books to be insightful
enough, that between your long hours caring for your patients, you'll get a
chance to sit down and grab a few moments with a multi-touch book to further
your knowledge. Thank you for all you do. We take great pride in our
responsibility to help you do it even better.

For the patients; nothing would make us prouder than to hear more stories of
you, downloading one of our books, to better understand your own healthcare.
Medicine can be intimidating and full of anxiety, but knowledge empowers, and
overcomes. We're there for you.

Most of all, Pinfinity is here to buck the status quo in medical education.
Access to information should be free, __especially__ when it comes to our
healthcare. We will strive to produce the most engaging medical learning
material in the digital age, and we will do it while asking nothing in return
from our readers. Medicine is simply too important for you to be forced to
continue lining the pockets of big, stale, publishing houses.

Maybe we're crazy, but then, maybe that's a good thing.
