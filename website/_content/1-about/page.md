			<h3 class="header light">Jeffrey Eakin M.D.</h3>
			<p class="bio"> Jeff is our founder and fearless leader. He is a
visionary and true entrepreneur to the bone. He's the one who risks life and
limb to make all the tough decisions needed to set the ship on the right course
(at least until the next time we change course).</p>
			<p class="bio">We hear he's also a pretty good surgeon. From what we
know, he has completed a Minimally Invasive, Bariatric and Robotic Surgery
Fellowship at the Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery at The Ohio State
University Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Scott Melvin. These days
he is practicing Minimally Invasive Gastrointestinal Surgery, in addition to
authoring multi-touch books to teach you all about it. So, to be frank, Jeff
knows his stuff.  </p>

			<h3 class="header light">David Wilmert</h3>
			<p class="bio">David is a business school graduate who has spent the
majority of his career in the medical field as a sales representative (we love
him anyway). He has a passion for the advancement of medicine, which became
pronounced when he co-founded Pinfinity with his friend Jeff. David is possibly
the most talented individual on the planet when it comes to putting the right
people together to do something great. He is the Chief of Operations at
Pinfinity, but you could call him the chief cat herder, digital marketing
strategist, or an online collaboration specialist, depending on the hour of the
day.  </p>

			<h3 class="header light">Kris Walker</h3>
			<p class="bio">Kris is trained in film and multi-media production, but
when the World Wide Web thing got big, he correctly surmized that learning
computer programming would be a good use of time.  When he is not working on
the next piece of digital media software, Kris can usually be found trying to
get to the top of some big mountain (and safely back down).  Currently, Jeff
and Dave have Kris locked up in an undisclosed cave where he is busy as the
chief Information technologist for Pinfinity, which in our case, means building
websites and amazing software for creating even more amazing multi-touch books.
